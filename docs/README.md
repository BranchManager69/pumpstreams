# PumpStreams Documentation Hub

Welcome to the PumpStreams docs, a GitBook-style knowledge base that we self-host directly from this server. The goal is to keep operators, developers, and partners aligned on how the platform works, how to deploy and maintain it, and how to tap into realtime market data.

Use the navigation to explore end-to-end guides, operational runbooks, and deep technical references. Each section is written so that you can share a single canonical URL (for example `https://docs.your-domain.tld`) and everyone reads the latest agreed-upon version.

> **Need another doc set?** We can spin up additional subtrees or subdomains for more focused audiences (external API consumers, internal ops, etc.). Let me know and we will map out the structure together.
