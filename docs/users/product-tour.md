# Product Tour (Draft)

_This page is in progress._ It will walk new users through the PumpStreams surfaces—dashboard, livestream explorer, and alerting—highlighting the key actions they can take without needing to read the developer or integration tracks.

Topics we plan to cover:

- Navigating the `pump.dexter.cash` dashboard UI
- Understanding the columns, leaderboards, and live tiles
- Basic glossary for viewers and traders entering the ecosystem
- Tips for staying within rate limits and getting notified about new streams

> Want to help? Drop notes in the docs backlog and we will fold them into this tour.
