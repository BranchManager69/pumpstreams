# Architecture Notes (Draft)

_This section is queued up for a deeper dive._ It will capture a system-level overview so new engineers can orient quickly.

Outline:

- High-level boxes-and-arrows for ingest → storage → dashboard
- Where the PM2 processes (`pumpstreams-api`, `pumpstreams-fe`) fit and how failover works
- Supabase schema quick reference plus data retention policy
- Observability stack (logs, metrics, alerts) and how to extend it

Ping the engineering channel with diagrams or notes and we will translate them into this chapter.
