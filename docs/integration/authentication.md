# Authentication & Access Control (Draft)

_This page is being drafted._ It will document how partners request credentials, how we issue and rotate keys, and the headers or JWT scopes required for each API.

Planned coverage:

- Supabase service role vs. anon keys for read-only dashboards
- LiveKit token minting flow (viewer vs. publisher roles)
- API key distribution process and governance
- Sample client snippets for Node, Python, and cURL showing the auth handshake

Until this is complete, coordinate access with the integrations team directly.
