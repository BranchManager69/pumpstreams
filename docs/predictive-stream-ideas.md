# Pumpstreams Predictive Broadcast Concepts

## Chapter 1 – Pumpstreams Control Room (RedZone Clone)

**Vision**

A 24/7 broadcast modeled after NFL RedZone. An AI host sits at a virtual desk, calls out the hottest Pump.fun streams, and cuts instantly to whichever stream is about to explode.

**Key Segments**

1. **Opening Bell** – Top-of-hour hype monologue, current leaderboard, day theme.
2. **Red Alert** – Automatic cutaway with overlays when momentum crosses threshold.
3. **Momentum Meter** – Persistent ticker with stream velocity, hype, whales.
4. **Octo-Box** – Multibox view when several streams spike simultaneously.
5. **Halftime AI Interview** – Host chats with an AI persona (quant, meme lord) every 30 minutes.

**Visual/Audio Stack**

- OBS/ffmpeg scenes (host desk, overlays, real stream video).
- TTS host with event-driven lines; eventual GPT+Wav2Lip persona.
- Sound cues for alerts and leaderboard changes.

**Data Requirements**

- Real-time metrics (viewer delta, volume, sentiment).
- Threshold definitions for cues; service publishes events to streamer engine.

**MVP (Tonight-level scope)**

- Static scene with top-5 overlay.
- TTS host script every few minutes.
- "Red Alert" text overlay when momentum hits threshold.
- Optional one-liners from small TTS library.

**Future Upgrades**

- Replace overlays with actual live stream video.
- Replay button (last 30s of a spike) with AI narration.
- Chat-driven requests for specific streams.

## Chapter 2 – Predictive Battle/Bingo (AI Prediction Market)

**Vision**

An always-on sportsbook for Pump.fun streams. The agent lists binary markets on near-term outcomes, takes stakes via X402, and settles automatically. The live video shows odds, big bets, and countdowns.

**Components**

1. **Market Generator** – Create 1–3 binary markets every N minutes based on momentum metrics.
2. **Order Intake** – Users place YES/NO bets through the agent; funds held via X402 escrow.
3. **Settlement** – Agent computes results after window and pays out automatically.
4. **On-Stream Board** – Live odds, pool size, big wagers, countdowns, sound effects.
5. **Leaderboards** – Track bettor hits, ROI, display on stream.

**Implementation Steps**

1. **Hot Hand Board (MVP)** – No wagering; display automated probabilities on stream.
2. **Micro Market Prototype** – Launch one market per 10 minutes, initially limited stakes.
3. **Production Market Engine** – Robust event definitions, audit logs, fee structure.
4. **Advanced Features** – Laddered timeframes, parlays, user-generated markets, upset recaps.

**Automation**

- Agent owns market creation, odds posting, escrow, settlement. No manual steps.
- Metrics used for settlement stored immutably (Supabase snapshots).

## Chapter 3 – AI Meme Streamer (Intermission)

- Runs during lulls or as scheduled breaks.

**Extensions**

## Chapter 4 – Community Wall of Fame

**Vision**

User-submitted clip highlight reel with voting and rewards, integrated into the main broadcast.

**Flow**

1. Submission via agent (timestamp).
2. Auto filter/moderation, select top clips.
3. On-stream highlight reel with overlays.
4. Viewer voting; winners get shoutouts/perks.
5. Leaderboard for creators.

**Extensions**
