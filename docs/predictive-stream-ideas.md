# Pumpstreams Predictive Broadcast Concepts

This document captures the long-form plans for turning Pumpstreams into a persistent, AI-driven broadcast. Each “chapter” describes a major pillar, why it matters, the technical spine, and how it evolves from MVP to crown-jewel experience.

---

## Chapter 1 – Pumpstreams Control Room (RedZone Clone)

### Vision

Build the crypto equivalent of NFL RedZone. A charismatic AI host sits at a virtual desk, calls out the hottest Pump.fun streams, and instantly cuts to whichever stream is about to explode. The broadcast never sleeps; it feels like a professional control room tracking the action in real time.

### Why it matters

- **Differentiation** – Puts Pumpstreams in front of viewers even when they aren’t actively trading.
- **Retention** – Viewers can leave the broadcast on in the background and rely on the host to interrupt when something big happens.
- **Foundation** – The visual/audio shell that every other idea plugs into (prediction market overlays, meme segments, clip highlights).

### Anchor Segments

1. **Opening Bell** – Top-of-hour hype monologue, “games of the day,” leaderboard reset.
2. **Red Alert** – When a stream’s momentum score crosses a threshold, cut in with a klaxon, PIP view, and a quick stat rundown.
3. **Momentum Meter** – Persistent ticker showing changes in viewers, trade velocity, wallet inflows, chat sentiment.
4. **Octo-Box** – Multibox view when several streams spike together; overlay mini leaderboards showing race-style stats.
5. **Halftime AI Interview** – Every 30 minutes the host talks with an AI persona (quant analyst, meme lord, “insider”) recapping major moves.
6. **After Hours Recap** – Once per day highlight reel summarizing the biggest hits/misses, seeding storylines for the next session.

### Tech & Data Spine

- **Stream renderer**: OBS Studio or ffmpeg/gstreamer to composite host desk, tickers, and live stream feeds. Controlled via OBS WebSocket or custom scene-switching scripts.
- **Voice stack**: Start with 11Labs or OpenAI TTS for event-driven scripts. Upgrade to GPT-generated scripts + Wav2Lip for lip-synced avatars.
- **Event bus**: Service publishes cue events (`stream_hot`, `multibox_ready`, `market_closed`) based on real-time metrics. Stream renderer subscribes and triggers scene changes.
- **Metric pipeline**: reuse existing Pumpstreams ingestion (viewer counts, trade volume, minted tokens, chat velocity). Add a derived “momentum score” (e.g., weighted z-score across metrics).

### MVP (shipping tonight is realistic)

- Static scene (host desk background + top 5 leaderboard overlay refreshed every minute).
- TTS host script at set intervals (“Welcome back to Pumpstreams Control Room…”).
- Simple “Red Alert” overlay (text + siren) when momentum score exceeds threshold.
- Optional: 10–20 pre-recorded quips to keep things light.

### Stage 2 Enhancements

- Swap overlays for actual live video using browser/RTMP sources.
- Introduce host left/right animations, camera zooms, and quick stats panels.
- Add replay function: record last 30 seconds of a stream, replay when an upset occurs, overlay AI commentary.
- Allow viewers to request stream spotlights via agent commands (host acknowledges on air).

### Stage 3 Crown Jewel

- Fully animated host with dynamic voice and lip-sync, able to answer viewer questions in near real time.
- Automated “desk analysts” (AI co-hosts) who join for segments (e.g., “Meme Minute,” “Whale Watch”).
- Narrative arcs across days (tracking records, rivalries between streamers, etc.).

### Monetization Hooks

- Sponsored segments (“Red Alert presented by ___”).
- Premium shoutouts for streamers (pay to guarantee a scheduled highlight).
- Promoted prediction markets layered directly into the broadcast.

## Chapter 2 – Predictive Battle/Bingo (AI Prediction Market)

### Vision

Turn the broadcast into an AI-powered sportsbook. The agent continuously lists binary markets on near-term outcomes (viewers, volume, price bursts), accepts stakes through X402, and settles automatically when the window closes. The on-stream board shows odds, liquidity, and biggest bettors.

### Market Lifecycle (agent-owned)

1. **Candidate selection** – Every N minutes, data service ranks streams by momentum and risk profile; top candidates feed the market generator.
2. **Contract creation** – Agent posts `YES/NO` market with defined start/end time, target metric, and payout schedule. Example: “Will Stream Nova gain ≥15% viewers by 18:45 UTC?”
3. **Order intake** – Users interact with the agent (web UI, chat, CLI). Agent escrows funds via X402 and records positions.
4. **Odds updates** – Pricing model adjusts implied probabilities; board flashes when odds move or big bets land.
5. **Settlement** – At expiry, agent queries snapshot metrics, determines outcome, pays winners, logs results in Supabase.
6. **Leaderboard refresh** – Bettor stats updated; AI host recaps upsets and streaks.

### Data & Risk Controls

- Use the same momentum score + derived features (viewer rate of change, trade volume velocity, liquidity depth, unique wallet inflow).
- Record snapshots for each market to an immutable table (`market_id`, `metric_snapshot`, `settlement_summary`).
- Limit early-stage markets to capped stakes or require balanced order book before acceptance.
- Fee model (e.g., 2% of pot or 5% of payouts) to cover risk and fund operations.

### UX/Presentation

- **On-stream board**: shows market name, countdown timer, `YES` vs `NO` odds, pool size, and last major wager.
- **Ticker**: rotating log of wagers (“0xF00D bet 25 SOL YES on Stream Apex”).
- **Alerts**: big bet triggers siren; AI host announces the whale.
- **Post-market recap**: host narrates outcome, payout multiple, effect on bettor leaderboard.

### Implementation Phases

1. **Hot Hand Board (probabilities only)** – Already described in Chapter 1; acclimates viewers to the predictive layer.
2. **Micro Market Prototype** – Single live market at a time, low stakes, agent hedges small risk if order book unbalanced.
3. **Production Engine** – Multiple concurrent markets, automatic pricing, full X402 escrow, settlement ledger, error handling.
4. **Advanced Feature Set** – Laddered timeframes, parlay/streak bets, user-created markets (with agent review), optional NFT badges for notable wins.

### Monetization & Compliance Notes

- Revenue through fees, sponsorship on specific contests, premium analytics access.
- Provide clear disclaimers (“entertainment only,” terms for settlement, dispute window).
- Add guardrails for suspicious activity (e.g., cap per-wallet exposure, flag correlated bets) before launching at scale.

## Chapter 3 – AI Meme Streamer (Intermission Programming)

### Vision

Keep viewers entertained during lulls with short, AI-generated comedy segments. Think “Weekend Update” meets meme culture: rapid-fire jokes, reenactments of rugs, and playful banter from fictional characters.

### Content Pipeline

1. **Event sourcing** – Monitor metrics + social chatter to spot notable moments (dramatic rug, hero 10x trade, influencer beef).
2. **Narrative builder** – GPT condenses the event into a comedic script (setup → twist → punchline). Include references to real numbers so the humor feels grounded.
3. **Asset generator** – Use existing screenshots, auto-captured video, or run an image generator to produce meme frames.
4. **Rendering** – Combine TTS voiceover with slideshow/animated avatar (e.g., puppeteer.js controlling a VTuber rig).
5. **Scheduling** – Insert between prediction markets or when Red Alert system is quiet; also use as “commercial breaks.”

### Expansion Ideas

- **Recurring characters** – “Bot Trader Bob,” “Degen Debra,” “Liquidity Larry.”
- **Audience prompts** – Viewers feed catchphrases; agent incorporates top picks into next segment.
- **Interactive memes** – Poll viewers on best punchline, show results live.
- **Crossovers** – Meme character can co-host short segments of the Control Room or critique bettor leaderboards.

### Tooling Checklist

- Script generation: OpenAI GPT-4.1 with custom style prompt.
- Voice: 11Labs, Suno, or OpenAI TTS for consistency.
- Visuals: simple slideshow via ffmpeg or OBS browser source animating assets.
- Asset archive: store generated memes in Supabase Storage with metadata for reuse in recap episodes.

## Chapter 4 – Community Wall of Fame

### Vision

Empower the Pumpstreams community to surface the best moments. Users submit clips/screenshots, the agent curates, the broadcast showcases them, and the audience votes. Winners get spotlighted and can feed back into prediction markets.

### User Flow

1. **Submission** – Viewer triggers agent command with stream + timestamp or uploads a clip.
2. **Ingestion** – Agent fetches media (via Pumpstreams archive API or direct upload), stores in Supabase Storage, records metadata (stream ID, metric snapshot, submitter).
3. **Moderation** – Auto filters for NSFW/toxicity; optional human review queue when uncertain.
4. **Showcase** – During scheduled “Wall of Fame” segment, play top 3 clips with lower-thirds showing submitter, stream stats, and sponsor message.
5. **Voting** – Viewers vote via chat/website. Real-time tallies appear on-screen; winning clip returns for encore replay.
6. **Rewards** – Winner receives shoutout, on-chain badge, fee discount in next prediction market, or access to premium analytics.

### Integrations

- **Prediction Markets** – Immediately after showing a clip, spin up a quick market (“Will this stream double viewers in 10 minutes?”).
- **Meme Streamer** – Use winning clips as inspiration for comedic reenactments.
- **Control Room** – Host references Wall of Fame standings during regular segments.

### Incentive Ideas

- Seasonal leaderboard for best clip hunters.
- Badges that appear next to usernames when they interact with the agent.
- Partner with creators to co-host certain segments (shared revenue).

## Decision Criteria & Next Actions

| Idea | Impact | Difficulty | Time to MVP | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control Room | High – brand-defining | Medium | Hours | Backbone for everything else |
| Predictive Battle/Bingo | Very high – monetizable & viral | High | 1–3 days for micro market | Requires bulletproof settlement |
| AI Meme Streamer | Medium – keeps stream lively | Low/Medium | <1 day for basic | Great filler + social clip factory |
| Community Wall of Fame | Medium | Medium | 1–2 days | Drives UGC, ties into markets |

**Recommended cadence**

1. Ship tonight’s Control Room “Hot Hand” board + host commentary (Chapter 1 baseline).
2. Iterate into micro prediction markets over the weekend (Chapter 2 initial rollout).
3. Add Meme Streamer and Wall of Fame once the main loop is stable (next 1–2 weeks).
4. Revisit this document to plan user-created markets, advanced host persona, and sponsorship integrations.
